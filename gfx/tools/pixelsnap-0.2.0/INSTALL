1. To install, simply copy pixelsnap.py and pixelsnap.inx into your inkscape
    extensions directory.

    The exact folder may be different on your system, but on mine it's in
    ~/.config/inkscape/extensions/


COMMON PROBLEMS

1. I get a dialog box saying "ImportError: No module named inkex"

This is apparently an issue for Inkscape version 0.46. You need to manually
add your Inkscape's extensions modules directory to the top of pixelsnap.py.
Open that file, and find the section titled "INKEX MODULE"
